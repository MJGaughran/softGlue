# This record controls which edge of a signal causes an interrupt.
# This is a kludge implemented by softGlue's drvIP_EP201's readUInt32D() and
# writeUInt32D() to interpret the behavior of the mbbo record, and of
# asyn asynUInt32Digital support to implement a two-bit menu for the user,
# and have that menu control one bit of drvIP_EP201's risingIntEnable and
# fallingIntEnable registers.  The mask $(MASK) must have two adjacent bits
# set, the lower of which tells drvIP_EP201 which bit actually to read/write.
