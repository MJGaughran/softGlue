<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>softGlue Release Notes</H2>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Release 1-1 (May 11, 2010)</H2>
<UL>
	<li>Added the ability to load FPGA content at boot time, from a file, via
		the IP bus.
	<li>Modified the recommended method of loading EPICS support.  Now, user is
		expected to load the database directly from the softGlue module, so it's
		more likely to agree with FPGA content also loaded from softGlue.
	<li>Renamed ip1k125 to IP_EP200 or IP_EP201.
	<li>Now supporting 16 field-input bits, and 16-field output bits.
	<li>Added 32-bit up counters.
	<li>Added limited support for using Drag-And-Drop to connect signals.  If
		the string written to a signal is the PVname of some other signal
		pertaining to the same IP-EP201 module, device support will replace the
		PVname with the string value of the PV.  This connects signals only if
		the Drag-And-Drop source PV was not the empty string.
	<li>Tighten up notion of legal signal names: leading spaces removed; for
		outputs, leading decimal digits alse removed.  Added PINI=YES to *Signal
		PV's, so rules are enforced also boot time.
	<li>Documentation
