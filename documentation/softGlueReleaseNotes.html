<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>softGlue Release Notes</H2>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Release 1-1 (June 14, 2010)</H2>
<UL>
	<li>Added the ability to load FPGA content at boot time, from a file, via
		the IP bus.
	<li>Modified the recommended method of loading EPICS support.  Now, user is
		expected to load the database directly from the softGlue module, so it's
		more likely to agree with FPGA content also loaded from softGlue.
	<li>Renamed ip1k125 to IP_EP200 or IP_EP201.
	<li>Now supporting 16 field-input bits, and 16-field output bits.
	<li>Added 32-bit up counters.
	<li>Added limited support for using Drag-And-Drop to connect signals.  If
		the string written to a signal is the PVname of some other signal
		pertaining to the same IP-EP201 module, device support will replace the
		PVname with the string value of the PV.  This connects signals only if
		the Drag-And-Drop source PV was not numeric, and not an empty string.
	<li>Tighten up notion of legal signal names: leading spaces removed; for
		outputs, leading decimal digits alse removed.  Added PINI=YES to *Signal
		PV's, so rules are enforced also boot time.
	<li>Input signal names ending with '*' are allowed, denote the same signal
		as the same signal name without a trailing '*', and indicate that the
		signal value is to be run through an inverter before being applied to
		the circuit element.
	<li>use msi to build partially resolved databases, so user can supply their
		own P and H macros, without having to supply everything else.
	<li>interrupt handling worked only when both edges were enabled
	<li>user can modify interrupt enables, and poll time for non-interrupting
		field I/O signals, at run time.
	<li>interrupt handler throttles interrupts
	<li>included records for interrupts to drive; implemented GUI for users to
		manage this.
	<li>added BURT request file to save all of softGlue
	<li>added 8 MHz clock
	<li>decrement user's down-counter N value before writing to FPGA
	<li>Documentation and examples
